More You, Less Chores - Get your child to help you at home

## What is this application about?

In this project I am aiming at converting a wallchart where we record our kid's good and bad behaviour into a web app.
The main idea is for your kid to collect points and get stars as a reward. You decide what they get for a star :).

## What tech is used?

The app is written using **python / Django** and a few helpful libraries:
- bootstrap
- django-bootstrap4 (excellent way of making forms look good, it's a godsend, check it out at: <https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap4>)
- django-static-precompiler (way to use scss without any watchers and other complications, big thx to this project: <https://github.com/andreyfedoseev/django-static-precompiler>).

## How to use the app?

- Simply sign up and create your account. This account will be classified as a parent account.
- You should see an icon of a profile - navigate to dashboard
- Create your first child profile in dashboard. Notice that all child profiles are users like you but with read-only access.
- Add smileys and oopsies :) when they deserve them.
- Give details of the child account if you wish so to your kid so they can view their progress!
